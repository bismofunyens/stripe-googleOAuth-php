# stripe-googleOAuth-php
A web app that uses Google OAuth 2.0 verification and Stripe payment. Google OAuth is used based off user session data when a user logs in with their Google account. Once logged in, the session data will display the users profile picture (if they set one), first, and last name. Once logged into the system, you will redirected to the user dashboard screen. Press the "Load Credit" button on the top right to test the Stripe payment system. When asked for CC info, fill out the form with whatever name you choose, but fill out the CC number with the following: "4242 4242 4242 4242" CSV: 424. Once you submit payment, you will be redirected to a success page verifying your purchase. You can then redirect yourself back to the dashboard and navigate to the transaction history panel on right. This will show your transaction history based on Order ID, customer name, price, product, date purchased.
